USER VISIBLE CHANGES ADDED TO XSC
=================================

. Automatic generation of encoding and decoding operations from an XML schema.
  More often than not, Xqueries are executed by a client/peer on a server/peer.
  The results of these operations are subset of the XML schema elements. To
  enable this, we have been adding support for generation of automatic
  insertion and extraction operators to convert XML data to CDR representation.
  Common Data Representation (CDR) is used by CORBA as the encoding format
  for communication. To use these options on your schema please use the
  following command line options: --cxx-generate-cdr-reader-types (for
  operations that extracts a XML type from a CDR Output stream) and
  --cxx-generate-cdr-writer-types (for operations that inserts a XML type
  from a CDR Input stream).

Requirements:
=============

. This feature requires that the generated code be linked with the ACE
  framework toolkit, which is an open-source framework for building
  distributed applications. ACE can be downloaded from the following
