This is a set of notes to myself regarding possible future enhancements.

*  In the xsd:choice mapping:  perhaps we should have an enum with the various possibilities
   so that users don't have to perform a linear search to determine which type
   is contained in the choice.

*  Enable capability to use ACE macros to define other basic types besides char.

*  Elements can't have the same name of types.
